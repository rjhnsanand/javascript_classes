// Data stored using constant can't be changed, it's fixed.
// Data stored with variable can be changed

// Camel case is when the first alphabet of the second word is capitalised.

// const is used to refer Constants, which cannot be changed later.
// let and var are variable.
// var should not be used, let should be used all the time.
/* like in userCity if you don't declare a type of variable, javascript will still count it as a variable, it is not recommended though.
Always declare the type of variable initially you wan to work with */

console.log([userId, userName, userPassword, userCity]);

// multiple variables can be dispalyed using both table and log commands
// variables need to pass through []
